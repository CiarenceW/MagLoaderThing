## Installation
- Install the [latest BepinEx 5 release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) </br>
- Extract the MagLoaderThing folder to (where you have Receiver 2 installed) Receiver 2\BepInEx\plugins
## How to use
- Should automatically be enabled when entering the compound.
- If you have the Manual Activation option on (in BepInEx's config), you can remap the option called "Ending Mistake" in the keybinds menu from the game to whatever you want
- In front on the funky white cubes (located on the ammo tables in the shooting range and the challenge dome), with a mag in your hand, tap (quickly) the **interact key** to rapidly insert boolets
